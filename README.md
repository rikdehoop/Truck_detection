https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/index.html -> prepaired training data, further research needed on this

https://www.ml.cmu.edu/research/dap-papers/f18/dap-kaack-lynn.pdf -> simulair paper as to what this project is trying to achieve

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07660 -> different method to achieve a simulair goal using remote sensing in combination with object detection

blog.roboflow.com/yolov5-for-oriented-object-detection/ -> object oriented method, a model that detects also the orientation of an object, possible when expanding but no primary goal
