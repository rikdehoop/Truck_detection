BGT got parkeerspots in the wegdeel dataset, can be filtered out but maybe not complete in private areas

To prevent al containers to be detected even if there is no truck atached to it, we can choose to only train on the truck and not the atached container, altough this might give other unexpected issues, worth a discussion..

In post processing use lenght of object as filter-criteria to filter out the fans and smaller mis-detected vehicles
